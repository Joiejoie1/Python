Prerequisites
This course aims to be friendly and supportive of students new to programming / coding.

It is helpful, but not essential, if you have previous experience with:

Working with files and installing software on your computer
Using the command line interface in the terminal on your computer. Feel free to search for one or both of the following free courses in Udacity's course catalog and learn more about the command line interface:
Shell Workshop
Linux Command Line Basics
Coding in another programming language
If you don't have prior skills and experience with these, you will still be able to be successful in learning Python programming using the detailed instruction and guidance in this course. It will probably involve more time and patience though. Happy learning!
